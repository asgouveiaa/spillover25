The model framework exemplifies how the weather seasonality and extremes events would impact the zoonotic spillover risk in human-wild animals interactions. The weather in the model is basically described by the daily precipitation volume, given by a sinusoidal function that can incorporate effects from El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We are considering that fluctuations in precipitation naturally affects animal and human behaviours, with flood periods limiting fishing practices and boosting hunter activities, and also causing crowding of animals in dry areas.

Adapting a SIR model to account for the dynamics between susceptible, infected and recovered humans and animals. The humans are described by hunters, who search, capture and kill wild animals, and the consumers, which are characterized by individuals related or not to hunters who prepare and eat the hunted animal.

Paper under elaboration by two friends and a collegue.
